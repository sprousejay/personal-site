<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>My goal for this class is to better understand how websites work and how to build them on my own. After this class is over I would like to carry on to the next boot camp class.  My goal is to be proficient enough in coding to be able to get a new job in the coding field. In order for me to achieve my professional goals i need to make smaller goals like being more organized and disciplined with my work throughout the day.</p>
